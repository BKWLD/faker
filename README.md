Faker â€” A Fake Text Generator
=============================

This is more or less a direct PHP port of the Ruby Faker gem, which is more or less a direct port of the Perl Data::Faker from Cpan. Use it to generate ludicrous randomized text for functional testing, fuzz testing, or lorem ipsum-esque purposes.

Requirements
------------

- PHP 5.2+
- PEAR (apparently not at this stage)

Overview
--------

Right now there are only two parts to the Faker, a legacy Faker class, and Faker_Company.

Usage:

```
echo Faker::name();
echo Faker::paragraphs(3);
// etc...
```
